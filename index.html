    Heavy metal pollution in water is a critical environmental and public health issue, particularly in developing countries 
    and communities with limited access to clean drinking water. The use of polymers as adsorbents in the removal of heavy 
    metals in wastewater has become increasingly popular due to their unique properties such as their great surface area, 
    adjustable pore size and their cost-effectiveness. This article explores the mechanisms by which polymers extract heavy
    metals from wastewater. Additionally, advancements in polymer-based composites like polymer nanocomposites are discussed 
    highlighting efficiency in heavy metal removal and detection and the challenges which come with attempting to produce 
    these composites at a large scale.

    Heavy metals, dubbed as such due to their high densities, are comprised of a block of all the metals in groups 3 to 16 of the periodic
    table that are in periods 4 and greater (the transition and post-transition metals) <a href="#References">(Hawkes, 1997)</a>. Among these,
    heavy metal ions such as Cd<sup>2+</sup>, Pb<sup>2+</sup>, and Cu<sup>2+</sup> are recognised as highly toxic pollutants. The growing presence of heavy metals in bodies 
    of water  globally poses a significant harm to human health and environmental and economic activities. Research shows that the total 
    concentrations of heavy metal pollution is at their lowest in the 1970s and 1980s and at their highest in 21st century; the  declining 
    order of mean concentration over five decades for Cd was 1990 > 2010s > 2000s  > 1970s > 1980s. <a href="#References">(Zhou, et al., 2020)</a>.
    With the increasing rise in industrial waste, heavy metal contamination in aquatic environments is a growing concern. This has amplified the need
    for development of processses to treat wastewater efficiently. This article explores the use of polymers in heavy metal removal, looking into 
    future advancements and the challenges that optimisation of these polymer-based composites must navigate.

        The removal of heavy metals in wastewater by polymers was a process popularised in the 1970s due to recent developments in polymer technology. 
        Heavy metals are toxic and, when released into water sources, can accumulate in ecosystems, leading to bioaccumulation. This process harms 
        and disturbs ecosystems, particularly aquatic environments, where it disrupts the food chain: plants and other marine life absorb these 
        contaminants which they then carry along as they ascend the chain, threatening both biodiversity and agriculture. Heavy metal ions pose a 
        significant threat to human health and ingestion of these ions can lead to an increased susceptibility to cancer and
        respiratory disorders. Heavy metal pollution in water sources is a pressing issue for developing countries and rural communities,
        where access to clean, filtered drinking water is often limited. These populations are disproportionately vulnerable to the effects
        of heavy metal pollution as they lack resources to properly implement infrastructure to treat the water <a href="#References">(Chowdhury, et al., 2016)</a>.
        Adsorption in wastewater management has been established to be one of the most effective and simplest methods. 
        The unique physical properties of polymer adsorbents such as their large surface area, perfect skeleton strength and their adjustable 
        pore size distribution have made them popular material for effluent treatment  <a href="#References">(Kunin, 1977)</a>. 
        Research has also shown that polymers can efficiently remove both inorganic and organic pollutants <a href="#References">(Pan, et al., 2009)</a>.
        In addition to the efficiency of polymers, the adsorption process is cost effective and overall has an environmentally friendly nature, 
        making it one of the most widely used techniques for the removal of heavy metals from wastewater. <a href="#References">(Brirmi et al., 2024)</a>. 
        Adsorption occurs when an adsorbate accumulates on the surface of the adsorbents and forms an atomic or molecular film <a href="#References">(Jadoun, S et al., 2023)</a>.

        <p style="font-size: 20px;">
        The polymer adsorbs the heavy metal by forming chemical bonds with the metal or through ion exchange; the polymer binds to the metals 
        by these mechanisms and eliminates them from the wastewater. The heavy metals can then be removed from the polymer by using a 
        desorbing agent which then allows the polymer to be reused. The use of polymer-based composites for the removal metal
        ions from wastewater has been widely accepted due to their degradable properties <a href="#References">(Patwary, et al., 2020)</a>.
        Various polymer-based composites have been employed as adsorbents and there is ongoing research to identify the most efficient and effective
        materials for waste management, such as polymer nanocomposites. A polymer nanocomposite is product of a combination of polymers and
        inorganic/organic fillers at a nanoscale level <a href="#References">(Rivas, et al., 2015)</a>. Polymer nanocomposites have both the 
        surface properties of nanoparticles and the polymeric properties of polymers which allow it to bind to target heavy metals, making them
        effective adsorbers and detectors of pollutants. Despite their potential, the large-scale production of polymer-based composites remains
        a challenge due to the complexity of their synthesis process. Recent advancements in polymer-based composites have focused on enhancing 
        their adsorption efficiency and specificity for heavy metal ions, for example functionalized polymers have shown significant improvement 
        in binding strength for specific metals like lead (Pb) and arsenic (As) <a href="#References">(Lofrano et al., 2016)</a>. 
        While these innovations a greatly exciting and promising, scaling up for industrial applications continues to be an obstacle.

        Heavy metal contamination of water remains a global concern, driven by industrial activities and inadequate wastewater management worldwide.
        The use of polymers for the treatment of wastewater has proven to be an effective, ecological  and inexpensive method. Their ability to bind to   
        heavy metals through multiple mechanisms and their  structural versatility makes them a valuable tool in water managemet. Ongoing research aims
        to improve their already impressive performance by enhancing their adsorption capacity and selectivity, such as polymer nanocomposites, 
        providing a promising advancemt in this field. However, their complex synthesis and scalability challenges their ability to be produced at large scales.
